## This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) blog project inspired a lot from [Next.js](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

I removed lots of commponents that is not fitable in next15, mainly analyze components.And I removed the comment part.I'm planning to build it on my own.

Besides, it's still under development, and I think this version is a good start for those who wants to build a fullstack blog from a beginner.

This project uses [lxgw-wenkai](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) font.
