## Overview

This repository is a pared‑down [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) blog starter, heavily inspired by the excellent [tailwind‑nextjs‑starter‑blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It has been cleaned up and updated for **Next.js 15** compatibility.

- **Analytics components removed** – they aren’t yet compatible with Next 15.
- **Comment system removed** – I plan to build a custom solution later.

Although still under active development, this version offers a clear, beginner‑friendly foundation for anyone who wants to create a full‑stack blog.

The project comes pre‑configured with the elegant **LXGW WenKai** font.
